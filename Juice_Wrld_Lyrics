Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Told her if I die, yeah, I'ma die young
Every day I've been getting fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shawty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm looking for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timing
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I'on even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)
Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin'
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps callin' my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy
With my bros but I got my pole
Screamin', "Please don't urge me, please don't urge me, " yuh
Screamin', "Please don't urge me"
And fuck these hoes all they do is irk me
I smoke my dope and I pop my Perky
And lock my phone 'cause these hoes be lurkin', yuh
Yeah, these hoes be lurkin'
A bad lil' bitch with her hips so curvy
I drive my whip off the drugs, I'm swervin'
She ride my dick off the drugs, she swervin', woah
Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin'
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But the drugs won't hurt me, the drugs won't hurt me
Ex-girlfriend keeps callin' my phone
But the bitch can't hurt me, so I'm not worried
All alone, did it on my own
So I show no mercy, I show no mercy
With my bros but I got my pole
Screamin', "Please don't urge me, please don't urge me, " yuh (yuh)
Turned to a whole different person, drive my whip
Crash my whip off the drugs I'm swervin'

Oh my God, Ronny
The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience
T-Timing, timing, timing
All about timing, timing, timing
Sit back in my chair, relaxing and reclining
He has not a care in the world, no, I'm lying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me flying
Takin' all these meds to the face got me dying
Smoke 'til my mind frying, eyes red, high and crying
Numb the pain with Oxy and Dior, yeah, pricey
Juice like Tupac Shakur, no iced tea
Givenchy, Louis V, Double V, icy
Wedding ring, better things, better half, wifey
Only things numbing me from this hard life, uh, uh, alright
The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience
I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, sittin' up
Waiting, waiting, waiting, contemplating
My heart racing
Feels like I'ma die every second of the day
So I gotta get high
Ain't no coming down, ain't no coming down, why?
My anxiety bring me down, that's the fucking downside
It's like every time I ball, I just end up offside
This light of mine goes dim tonight
Will I be alright?
Let me guess, no answer, right?
The devil hit my phone, he wanna talk
But I'm not really up for conversations
I can have my cake and eat it too
I just gotta make a reservation
Chillin' in my head, but it's hot
Flames everywhere, I see Satan
Demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
Really, really runnin' out of patience

Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her

Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter

Popping wheelies, 4K Trey, call when you land with it (Pop, pop, pop)

Mmm, they're rottin' my brain, love
These hoes are the same
I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in
I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'
Hey, these girls are insane
Uh, all girls are the same
They're rottin' my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rottin' my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'
Ah, now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain
'Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't attain
'Cause all these girls the same, love
